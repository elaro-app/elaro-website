            <h1>How ELARO Works</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>Here's the Thing</h2>
                <p>You know that feeling when you're lying in bed at 11pm and suddenly remember you have an assignment due tomorrow? Or when you're sitting in an exam and realize you studied the wrong chapter?</p>
                <p>Yeah, we've been there too.</p>
                <p>ELARO won't magically make you a straight-A student—that's on you. But what it will do is remove the mental clutter. No more sticky notes everywhere. No more "wait, when was that due?" No more forgetting to review your notes.</p>
                <p>You focus on learning. We handle the remembering.</p>
            </section>

            <section style="counter-reset: step-counter;">
                <h2>How It Actually Works</h2>
                <p>Three things happen:</p>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Add your stuff</h3>
                    <p>Quick and easy. Course, date, time, done. Takes maybe 10 seconds. No complicated forms, no overwhelming options—just the basics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>We remind you</h3>
                    <p>Notifications before deadlines. Review reminders at the right times. You don't have to think about it.</p>
                    <p>For study sessions, we automatically schedule reviews: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 120 days, and 180 days later. It's called spaced repetition, and it works. Your brain remembers better when you review at these intervals.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>You focus on learning</h3>
                    <p>That's it. No more mental energy wasted on "did I forget something?" No more anxiety about deadlines. Just study.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
