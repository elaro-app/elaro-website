                <h2>Your Academic Co-Pilot</h2>
                <h3>A Smarter Way to Learn, Not Just Organize.</h3>
                <p>Every student knows the feeling: assignments scattered across notebooks, study sessions forgotten, and that constant anxiety of "what am I missing?" ELARO transforms this academic chaos into organized success.</p>
                <p>We're not just another calendar app—we're your intelligent academic co-pilot that handles the remembering so you can focus on the learning.

                <h2>The Simple 3-Step Process</h2>
                <h3>From Overwhelmed to In Control in Three Simple Steps.</h3>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 1: Capture Everything, Effortlessly</h3>
                    <h4>Capture Your Commitments in Seconds.</h4>
                    <p>Adding your academic life to ELARO is beautifully simple. With our intuitive floating action button, you can quickly add study sessions, assignments, and lectures in just a few taps. Choose your course, set the date and time, add any notes, and you're done. No complex forms, no overwhelming options; just a clean, modern interface that gets out of your way so you can focus on what matters: your education.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Let ELARO Handle the Remembering</h3>
                    <h4>Intelligent Reminders and a Proven System.</h4>
                    <p>ELARO works behind the scenes with two powerful reminder systems. First, smart notifications ensure you never miss deadlines—get reminded 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day before assignments and lectures. Second, our spaced repetition system uses research-backed intervals to help you remember what you study.</p>
                    <p>For study sessions, ELARO automatically schedules review reminders at the optimal times: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 120 days, and 180 days after your initial study session. This proven method increases long-term retention by up to 400%, so you actually remember what you learn.</p>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Study with Confidence</h3>
                    <h4>Focus on Learning, Not Logistics.</h4>
                    <p>The result? A completely transformed academic experience. Your mind is clear because ELARO handles all the remembering. You never miss deadlines because smart reminders keep you on track. You retain information better because spaced repetition works with your brain's natural learning patterns.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, you can focus entirely on learning instead of worrying about organization. Students using ELARO report feeling more confident, less stressed, and more in control of their academic success.</p>
