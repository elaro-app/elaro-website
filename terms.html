            <h1>ELARO â€” Terms of Service</h1>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to ELARO! This Terms of Service document ("Terms") is a legally binding agreement between you ("you," "the User") and <strong>Alidu Yakubu Suhyini Mansur</strong>, an individual operator based in Ghana ("ELARO," "we," "us," or "our").</p>
            <p>If the Service is transferred to a registered company in the future, we will notify you. Your continued use of the Service after such notification will constitute your acceptance of the transfer and any updated Terms.</p>
            <p><strong>By creating an account or using the Service, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. Our <a href="https://myelaro.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data. By agreeing to these Terms, you also agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
            <p><strong>2.1. Age Requirement.</strong> To use the Service, you must be at least 13 years old.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Users 18 and Over:</strong> If you are 18 years of age or older, you may agree to these Terms and use the Service directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Users Between 13 and 17:</strong> If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you represent and warrant that you have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Users Under 13:</strong> This Service is not directed at or intended for users under 13. If you are under 13, you may not use this Service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2.2. Parental Rights.</strong> Parents or legal guardians may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@myelaro.com">support@myelaro.com</a> at any time to review, update, or request the deletion of their child's personal data.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3. Account Security.</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding your account password and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</p>

            <h2>3. Subscriptions, Billing, and Payments</h2>
            <p><strong>3.1. Subscription Plans.</strong> The Service is available under different plans, including a free plan ("Free Plan") and one or more paid subscription plans ("Premium Plans").</p>
            <p><strong>3.2. Automatic Renewal.</strong> <strong>Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</strong> You must manage your cancellation through the platform where you made the purchase (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store).</p>
            <p><strong>3.3. Price Changes.</strong> We reserve the right to change subscription prices. We will provide you with reasonable notice before any price changes take effect upon your next renewal.</p>
            <p><strong>3.4. Payments and Refunds.</strong> All payments are processed through third-party platforms. Refund requests must be submitted directly to the platform where you made the purchase. For any direct payments made outside of app stores (e.g., via mobile money), refund requests must be submitted to <a href="mailto:support@myelaro.com">support@myelaro.com</a> within 14 days of payment, and refunds are granted only if the Service failed to function as advertised.</p>
            <p><strong>3.5. Payment Failure & Grace Period.</strong> If a subscription payment fails, your account will enter a 72-hour grace period, during which you will retain access to Premium features. We will notify you at the start of this period. If payment is not made within this period, your account will be downgraded to the Free Plan. Premium-only data will remain stored but inaccessible until you re-upgrade.</p>

            <h2>4. User Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p><strong>4.1. Your Ownership of Content.</strong> You retain all ownership rights to the information and data you submit to the Service ("User Content").</p>
            <p><strong>4.2. Our License to Your Content.</strong> To operate the Service, you grant ELARO a limited license to host, use, and process your User Content. This license continues only as long as your account is active and for a limited period thereafter for backup and recovery purposes. We may use Anonymized Data for analytics. "Anonymized Data" means data from which all personally identifiable information has been removed such that you cannot be reasonably identified.</p>
            <p><strong>4.3. Our Intellectual Property.</strong> The Service, its underlying technology, and any AI-generated insights are the exclusive intellectual property of ELARO. While ELARO owns any AI-generated insights, you retain full ownership of your underlying User Content.</p>
            <p><strong>4.4. Data Export.</strong> You may export your User Content at any time through the app's settings in a machine-readable format (such as JSON or CSV).</p>
            <p><strong>4.5. Copyright Policy.</strong> We respect intellectual property rights. If you believe content on the Service infringes your copyright, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@myelaro.com">legal@myelaro.com</a> with a takedown request.</p>

            <h2>5. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
            <p><strong>5.1. Acceptable Use.</strong> You agree to use the Service only for lawful, personal, and academic-planning purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>5.2. Prohibited Actions.</strong> You agree not to use the Service for prohibited activities, including using the Service to cheat on exams or plagiarize assignments. We reserve the right to investigate violations and report unlawful use to relevant authorities.</p>

            <h2>6. Termination and Suspension</h2>
            <p><strong>6.1. Termination by You.</strong> You may terminate this Agreement at any time by deleting your account.</p>
            <p><strong>6.2. Suspension and Termination by Us.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your account for violations of these Terms. Where practical, we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to remedy the violation before termination.</p>
            <p><strong>6.3. Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination, you can restore your account by logging back in within a 7-day period. After 7 days, your personal data will be permanently deleted from our active systems within 30 days. Some data may remain in encrypted backups for up to 90 days as part of our disaster recovery procedures. We are not liable for any loss of data resulting from account termination.</p>

            <h2>7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p><strong>7.1. Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> The Service is provided "AS IS." We do not warrant that it will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p>
            <p><strong>7.2. Disclaimer for Third-Party Services.</strong> We are not responsible for the failures or outages of our third-party service providers.</p>
            <p><strong>7.3. Limitation of Liability.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, ELARO and its Operator shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Liability Cap:</strong> <strong>In no event shall ELARO's total liability for any claim exceed (i) the total amount you paid for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or (ii) one U.S. dollar (USD $1.00) if you are using the Free Plan.</strong> As ELARO is currently operated by an individual, all limitations of liability herein shall apply to both the Service and its Operator personally to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>
            <p><strong>8.1. Governing Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>Republic of Ghana</strong>, subject to any mandatory consumer protection laws in your country of residence.</p>
            <p><strong>8.2. Informal Resolution.</strong> Before filing a claim, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@myelaro.com">support@myelaro.com</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>8.3. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong> If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, it must be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the <strong>Ghana Arbitration Centre</strong>. The arbitration will take place in Accra, Ghana, or may be conducted remotely via video conference upon mutual agreement. <strong>By agreeing to these Terms, you and ELARO each waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit.</strong> Nothing in this section limits any statutory rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws.</p>
            <p><strong>8.4. Arbitration Opt-Out.</strong> You may opt-out of this binding arbitration agreement. To opt-out, you must notify us in writing at <a href="mailto:legal@myelaro.com">legal@myelaro.com</a> within 30 days of creating your account. Your notice must include your first name, last name, username, and the email address associated with your account, along with a clear statement that you wish to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.</p>

            <h2>9. General Provisions</h2>
            <p><strong>9.1. Changes to Terms.</strong> We may modify these Terms and will provide you with reasonable notice of any material changes.</p>
            <p><strong>9.2. Force Majeure.</strong> We are not liable for any failure or delay due to events beyond our reasonable control.</p>
            <p><strong>9.3. Severability & No Waiver.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.</p>
            <p><strong>9.4. Notices.</strong> Notices sent to the email address you provide or to our support addresses shall be deemed received within 24 hours.</p>
            <p><strong>9.5. Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and ELARO.</p>
