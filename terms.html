            <h1>ELARO â€” Terms of Service</h1>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to ELARO! This Terms of Service document ("Terms") is a legally binding agreement between you ("you," "the User") and <strong>Alidu Yakubu Suhyini Mansur</strong>, an individual operator based in Ghana ("ELARO," "we," "us," or "our").</p>
            <p>If the Service is transferred to a registered company in the future, we will notify you. Your continued use of the Service after such notification will constitute your acceptance of the transfer and any updated Terms.</p>
            <p><strong>By creating an account or using the Service, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>1.1. Privacy Policy Reference.</strong> Your privacy is important to us. Our <a href="https://myelaro.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data. By agreeing to these Terms, you also agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>1.2. International Data Transfers.</strong> We use subprocessors that may process data in the United States and the European Union, including Supabase (database/backend), RevenueCat (subscriptions), Apple App Store and Google Play Store (payments), Sentry (error tracking), Mixpanel (analytics; opt-in), Expo (push notifications), Tawk.to (support chat), and React Native Purchases SDK. See our Privacy Policy for current subprocessors and transfer safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).</p>
            <p><strong>1.4. Marketing Communications.</strong> During account creation or onboarding, you may opt-in to receive marketing communications from us, including newsletters, promotional emails, feature announcements, and special offers. Marketing communications are separate from service-related notifications (such as account updates, security alerts, or reminders). You can opt-out of marketing communications at any time by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking the "unsubscribe" link in any marketing email</li>
                <li>Adjusting your preferences in the Service settings</li>
                <li>Contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@myelaro.com">support@myelaro.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Opting out of marketing communications will not affect service-related communications that are necessary for the operation of your account. If you are located in the European Union, your consent to receive marketing communications must be explicitly given (opt-in), and you may withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the legality of processing based on consent before withdrawal. For California residents, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information (though ELARO does not sell personal information) and the right to request details about how your information is used for marketing purposes.</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
            <p><strong>2.1. Age Requirement.</strong> To use the Service, you must be at least 13 years old.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Users 18 and Over:</strong> If you are 18 years of age or older, you may agree to these Terms and use the Service directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Users Between 13 and 17:</strong> If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you represent and warrant that you have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Users Under 13:</strong> This Service is not directed at or intended for users under 13. If you are under 13, you may not use this Service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2.2. Parental Rights.</strong> Parents or legal guardians may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@myelaro.com">support@myelaro.com</a> at any time to review, update, or request the deletion of their child's personal data.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3. Account Security.</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding your account password and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</p>

            <h2>3. Subscriptions, Billing, and Payments</h2>
            <p><strong>3.1. Subscription Plans.</strong> The Service is available under different plans, including a free plan ("Free Plan" or "Origin Plan") and one or more paid subscription plans ("Premium Plans" or "Oddity Plan"). The specific features, limits, and pricing for each plan are displayed in the Service and may change over time. We reserve the right to introduce new plans, modify existing plans, or discontinue plans with reasonable notice. Current plan details and pricing are available in the Service and may also be found on our website or app store listings.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2. Automatic Renewal.</strong> <strong>Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</strong> You must manage your cancellation through the platform where you made the purchase (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store).</p>
            <p><strong>3.3. Price Changes.</strong> We reserve the right to change subscription prices. We will provide you with reasonable notice before any price changes take effect upon your next renewal.</p>
            <p><strong>3.4. Payments and Refunds.</strong> All payments are processed through third-party platforms. Refunds for purchases made via Apple App Store or Google Play Store are handled directly by those stores under their respective policies. For any direct payments made outside of app stores (e.g., via mobile money), refund requests must be submitted to <a href="mailto:support@myelaro.com">support@myelaro.com</a> within 14 days of payment, and refunds are granted only if the Service failed to function as advertised.</p>
            <p><strong>3.5. Payment Failure & Grace Period.</strong> If a subscription payment fails, your account may enter a grace period determined by the app store and our subscription provider. During this time, you may retain access to Premium features. If payment is not resolved by the end of the grace period, your account will be downgraded to the Free Plan. Premium-only data remains stored but inaccessible until you re-upgrade.</p>
            <p><strong>3.7. Free Trial Terms.</strong> New users may receive a 7-day free trial of Premium features ("Free Trial"). The Free Trial period begins automatically upon account creation. During the Free Trial, you will have access to all Premium features. At the end of the 7-day trial period, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription unless you cancel before the trial expires. You may cancel your Free Trial at any time through your account settings or the app store where you downloaded the Service. If you cancel during the trial period, you will not be charged. You acknowledge that each user is limited to one Free Trial per account, and we reserve the right to revoke trial access if we detect abuse or violation of these Terms.</p>
            <p><strong>3.8. Subscription Limits and Feature Restrictions.</strong> Different subscription tiers have different limits on usage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free Plan:</strong> Users on the Free Plan may create up to 15 tasks (assignments, lectures, or study sessions) per 30-day period, manage up to 2 courses, and create up to 5 Spaced Repetition System (SRS) reminders per month.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium Plan (Oddity):</strong> Users on the Premium Plan may create up to 70 tasks per 30-day period, manage up to 10 courses, and create up to 50 SRS reminders per month.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These limits reset every 30 days from your account creation date (for Free Plan users) or subscription start date (for Premium Plan users). If you exceed these limits, you may be required to upgrade to a higher tier or wait until your usage resets. We reserve the right to modify these limits with reasonable notice. Current limits are displayed in the Service, and you acknowledge that these limits may change over time.</p>
            <p><strong>3.9. Trial Conversion.</strong> If you do not cancel your Free Trial before it expires, your account will automatically convert to a paid subscription, and you will be charged according to the then-current subscription price for the Premium Plan. The billing cycle will begin immediately upon trial expiration. By starting a Free Trial, you authorize us to charge your payment method on file (if provided) or through your app store account at the end of the trial period, unless you cancel as specified in Section 3.7. You acknowledge that if you start a Free Trial and do not cancel before it expires, you consent to the subscription and agree to pay the subscription fee.</p>

            <h2>4. User Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p><strong>4.1. Your Ownership of Content.</strong> You retain all ownership rights to the information and data you submit to the Service ("User Content").</p>
            <p><strong>4.2. Our License to Your Content.</strong> To operate the Service, you grant ELARO a limited license to host, use, and process your User Content. This license continues only as long as your account is active and for a limited period thereafter for backup and recovery purposes. We may use Anonymized Data for analytics. "Anonymized Data" means data from which all personally identifiable information has been removed such that you cannot be reasonably identified.</p>
            <p><strong>4.3. Our Intellectual Property.</strong> The Service, its underlying technology, and any automated insights and recommendations are the exclusive intellectual property of ELARO. While ELARO owns any automated insights and recommendations, you retain full ownership of your underlying User Content.</p>
            <p><strong>4.4. Data Export.</strong> You may export your data at any time from the app's Settings in a machine-readable format (currently JSON). Exports are limited to once every 7 days to ensure system stability.</p>
            <p><strong>4.5. Copyright Policy.</strong> We respect intellectual property rights. If you believe content on the Service infringes your copyright, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@myelaro.com">legal@myelaro.com</a> with a takedown request.</p>
            <p><strong>4.8. Analytics and Performance Monitoring.</strong> Analytics are disabled by default and require your explicit opt-in in Settings. When enabled, we avoid sending PII and sanitize properties prior to transmission. You can opt out at any time.</p>

            <h2>5. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
            <p><strong>5.1. Acceptable Use.</strong> You agree to use the Service only for lawful, personal, and academic-planning purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>5.2. Prohibited Actions.</strong> You agree not to use the Service for prohibited activities, including using the Service to cheat on exams or plagiarize assignments. We reserve the right to investigate violations and report unlawful use to relevant authorities.</p>
            <p><strong>5.6. Rate Limiting and Fair Use.</strong> To ensure fair use and system stability, we implement rate limiting on API requests and certain operations within the Service. These limits are designed to prevent abuse while allowing normal use. Typical rate limits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Up to 100 creation requests per minute per user for assignments, lectures, and study sessions</li>
                <li>Up to 50 creation requests per minute per user for courses</li>
                <li>Up to 200 update requests per minute per user</li>
                <li>Up to 50 deletion requests per minute per user</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you exceed these limits, you may receive a rate limit error (HTTP 429) with information about when you can retry. We reserve the right to adjust these limits, implement additional restrictions, or temporarily or permanently suspend accounts that consistently exceed rate limits or engage in abusive behavior. We may also implement automated measures to detect and prevent abuse, including but not limited to detecting unusual usage patterns, automated account creation, or attempts to circumvent these limits.</p>

            <h2>6. Termination and Suspension</h2>
            <p><strong>6.1. Termination by You.</strong> You may terminate this Agreement at any time by deleting your account.</p>
            <p><strong>6.2. Suspension and Termination by Us.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your account for violations of these Terms, suspicious or fraudulent activity, or for any other reason we determine necessary to protect the Service, other users, or our rights. Account suspension may be temporary or indefinite, depending on the severity of the violation.</p>
            <p><strong>Suspension Process:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Notice:</strong> Where practical and not harmful to our rights or other users, we will provide you with notice of the suspension and the reason (except where disclosure would compromise an investigation or security measure).</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Temporary suspensions may have a specified end date, while indefinite suspensions remain in effect until we determine whether to restore or permanently terminate the account.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Access:</strong> During suspension, you may not be able to access your account or data. Premium-only data will remain stored but inaccessible until the suspension is lifted or your account is terminated.</li>
                <li><strong>Appeals:</strong> If your account is suspended, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@myelaro.com">legal@myelaro.com</a> to request review of the suspension. We will review appeals within 14 business days, but we are not obligated to restore suspended accounts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts immediately, without prior notice, for severe violations such as fraud, abuse of other users, illegal activity, or threats to the security of the Service. We are not required to provide a refund or credit for any unused subscription time if your account is terminated for violation of these Terms.</p>
            <p><strong>6.3. Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon account deletion, you can restore your account by logging back in within 7 days. After the 7-day restoration window, your personal data is scheduled for permanent deletion from active systems. Residual encrypted backups may persist for a limited period for disaster recovery and are automatically purged thereafter. We are not liable for any loss of data resulting from account termination.</p>

            <h2>7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p><strong>7.1. Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, error-free, or free from viruses or other harmful components. We do not guarantee that the Service will be available at all times or that all features will function as expected. The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, technical issues, or circumstances beyond our control, including failures of third-party services, internet outages, or force majeure events. We are not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from your inability to access or use the Service at any time.</p>
            <p>We do not warrant that the Service will meet your specific requirements, that the operation of the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that defects in the Service will be corrected. No oral or written information or advice provided by us, our employees, agents, or representatives will create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.</p>
            <p><strong>7.2. Disclaimer for Third-Party Services.</strong> We are not responsible for the failures or outages of our third-party service providers, including but not limited to: Supabase (database/backend), RevenueCat (subscriptions), Apple App Store and Google Play Store (payments), Sentry (error tracking), Mixpanel (analytics; opt-in), Expo (push notifications), Tawk.to (support chat), and React Native Purchases SDK. These services have their own terms of service and privacy policies, and you acknowledge that your use of such services is subject to those terms and policies.</p>
            <p><strong>7.3. Limitation of Liability.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, ELARO and its Operator shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Liability Cap:</strong> <strong>In no event shall ELARO's total liability for any claim exceed (i) the total amount you paid for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or (ii) one U.S. dollar (USD $1.00) if you are using the Free Plan.</strong> As ELARO is currently operated by an individual, all limitations of liability herein shall apply to both the Service and its Operator personally to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>7.4. Automated Insights and Recommendations Disclaimer.</strong> The Service may provide automated insights and recommendations. These are for informational purposes only; accuracy is not guaranteed. You are responsible for verifying any insights before relying on them. If generative AI features are introduced in the future, we will update these Terms and seek any additional consents required.</p>
            <p><strong>7.6. Beta and Preview Features.</strong> From time to time, we may offer access to beta, preview, or experimental features ("Beta Features"). Beta Features are provided "as is" and may be incomplete, unstable, or discontinued at any time. By using Beta Features, you acknowledge that they may contain errors, may not function as expected, may affect your experience with the Service, and may not be available in future versions. We may collect feedback, usage data, and performance metrics from Beta Features to improve them. We welcome feedback on Beta Features, but you acknowledge that any feedback or suggestions you provide may be used by ELARO without obligation to you. ELARO has no obligation to make Beta Features generally available, and we reserve the right to modify or discontinue Beta Features at any time, with or without notice.</p>

            <h2>8. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>
            <p><strong>8.1. Governing Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>Republic of Ghana</strong>, subject to any mandatory consumer protection laws in your country of residence.</p>
            <p><strong>8.2. Informal Resolution.</strong> Before filing a claim, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@myelaro.com">support@myelaro.com</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>8.3. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong> If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, it must be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the <strong>Ghana Arbitration Centre</strong>. The arbitration will take place in Accra, Ghana, or may be conducted remotely via video conference upon mutual agreement. <strong>By agreeing to these Terms, you and ELARO each waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit.</strong> Nothing in this section limits any statutory rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws.</p>
            <p><strong>8.4. Arbitration Opt-Out.</strong> You may opt-out of this binding arbitration agreement. To opt-out, you must notify us in writing at <a href="mailto:legal@myelaro.com">legal@myelaro.com</a> within 30 days of creating your account. Your notice must include your first name, last name, username, and the email address associated with your account, along with a clear statement that you wish to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.</p>

            <h2>9. General Provisions</h2>
            <p><strong>9.1. Changes to Terms.</strong> We may modify these Terms and will provide you with reasonable notice (at least 7 days, or up to 30 days for material changes) of any material changes through in-app notifications and/or email to the address associated with your account. Material changes will be communicated before they take effect, and your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms. If you do not agree to any material changes, you must discontinue use of the Service and may cancel your subscription in accordance with Section 3.2.</p>
            <p><strong>9.2. Force Majeure.</strong> We are not liable for any failure or delay due to events beyond our reasonable control.</p>
            <p><strong>9.3. Severability & No Waiver.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.</p>
            <p><strong>9.4. Notices.</strong> Notices sent to the email address you provide or to our support addresses shall be deemed received within 24 hours.</p>
            <p><strong>9.5. Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and ELARO.</p>
            <p><strong>9.6. Contact Information.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For general support: <a href="mailto:support@myelaro.com">support@myelaro.com</a></li>
                <li>For legal notices: <a href="mailto:legal@myelaro.com">legal@myelaro.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>9.7. Modifications to Service.</strong> We reserve the right to modify, suspend, discontinue, or terminate any part of the Service at any time, with or without notice. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding, removing, or modifying features</li>
                <li>Changing subscription tiers, limits, or pricing</li>
                <li>Implementing new restrictions or policies</li>
                <li>Discontinuing support for older app versions</li>
                <li>Changing third-party integrations or services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will provide reasonable notice of material changes that negatively affect your use of the Service, where practical. However, we are not obligated to provide notice for changes that improve the Service, add features, fix bugs, address security concerns, or comply with legal requirements. Your continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the modified Service. If you do not agree to any modifications, you must discontinue use of the Service and may cancel your subscription in accordance with Section 3.2.</p>
